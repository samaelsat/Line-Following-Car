# Line-Following-Car
 Autonomous line-following robot using Arduino, L298N motor driver, 2 TT gear motors &amp; 2 IR sensors. Detects and tracks black lines with real-time path correction. Features optimized PWM control for smooth movement. Simple logic: forward when clear, turn on line detection, stop when both sensors active. Perfect beginner robotics project.
